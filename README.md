# Description

A modpack designed specifically for Hypixel SkyBlock on modern versions.\
Goodbye, 1.8.9, you will be missed...

The **SBModernized** mod-pack will be developed over time to be optimized, pretty, and modifiable. At the moment, SBModernized is just a set of several great mods with preset default configs. However, to get this modpack into a _finished_ state I will be adding custom features to make customization quick and easy, but that's coming in the future.

# How to Use

This modpack is intended to be out-of-box play, but here I'll have helpful tips and potential issues you may run into.

## Requirements

- **Memory**:
  - _[Minimum]_ 6 GB RAM (3 GB Allocated)
  - _[Recommended]_ 12 GB RAM (6 GB Allocated)
- **Storage**: 1 GB available storage

## Setup

1. Like any other Modrinth modpack, simply open this modpack page in the Modrinth App and install your desired version.
2. Before starting the game, open the Settings (_gear icon_), click Java and Memory, and set a custom amount of allocated memory, or use the recommended settings below. Be sure to not set it too high, this can lead to performance issues.
   - 2560 MB Minimum Allocated
   - **6-8 GB RAM**: 3 GB Allocated
   - **12-16 GB RAM**: 6 GB Allocated
   - **24-32 GB RAM**: 8 GB Allocated
3. You can also set a custom window size or set fullscreen if desired, then start the game.
4. Also, importantly, you should go to `Options > Resource Packs` then click `Done` to be sure all the resource packs load properly.
5. You can change some settings before starting, but to change certain settings involving UI for mods like BetterF3, Skyblocker, SkyHanni, etc. you must join Hypixel SkyBlock.

Now you should be ready to just play! If you are playing in a resolution other than 1920x1080 you can change the UI as you go, referring to the below tips if needed.

## Resource Packs

It's recommended that you keep all the packs as-is, but here are the purposes of some of the packs.

1. **FurfSky Reborn** is _highly_ recommended. FurfSky is one of the best SkyBlock item resource packs with textures for almost every custom item in SkyBlock.
2. **Leaves Plus** is for more pretty leaves. This is well optimized but you may disable if it isn't your cup of tea.
3. **Crops & Foliage Variations** is for prettier crops. May have a performance hit on the garden or farm, but it seems to be well optimized.
4. **FreshAnimations** is for more lively mob animations. Pretty well optimized and should work fine in most appears, this is purely preference.
5. **Detailed Animations** has beautiful player animations, which also apply to NPCs and some enemies. Not as optimized as other packs, disable if needed.
6. **No Enchant Glint** can be used for removing the enchant glint.
7. **Serified Font** is another preference thing. Has no noticeable performance impact and looks perfect in a majority of UIs, and to some may look a lot better than Vanilla.

Try to keep the resource packs in their default order.

## Visuals & Audio

**Resolution**\
Because SBModernized was made for 1920x1080 monitors and optimized for my mid-level PC, other resolutions and PCs may need many changes to the HUD and graphics settings.\
There will be screenshots of different areas of the game with notes on which parts of the HUD are from what mods.

**Shaders**\
They work with a good PC; not high-end level but better than most.\
If the shaders don't run well for you, I recommend primarily playing with them off, then toggling the shaders with K when you want some nicer scenery while Fishing, Foraging, or Hunting.

**Clouds**\
For optimization, clouds are disabled on all the default shaders and we instead use Better Clouds, which still look good without being taxing on performance.

**Sound Physics**\
One included mod, Sound Physics, will not be for everyone. Set Friendly Mob and Hostile Mob sounds to 40%, then disable Sound Physics if you don't like the audio (_you can do this in the config or in the modrinth content menu_).

## User-Interface

**SkyHanni**: Use key Backslash in-game to modify some of the hud. This will likely need lots of editing if you use a resolution other than 1920x1080. It's UI includes the Custom Scoreboard, Sacks value display, location pathing, and more.

**SkyBlocker**: Use command `/widget` to modify SkyBlocker's Tablist widgets and some of its hud. Also `/skyblocker` for several other options, including `/skyblocker bars` for customizing the bars above the hotbar.

**SkyCubed**: Use command `/skycubed` to access SkyCubed's settings. You can also drag its map and info display (_box with current time_) by opening chat.

## Controls

**Common Keybinds**: Go to `Options > Controls > Key Binds` then use the search bar to find specific binds or browse all.

**SkyBlocker Shortcuts**: Use command `/skyblocker shortcuts` then scroll down to change any keybinds you wish to, including adding or removing any (_note: press 'Esc' after setting any keybind_).

Below are some notable keybinds (_all command binds are in SkyBlocker).

- **M**: Open Map (_Skycubed_)
- **Left Alt** (hold): Show tab secondary view (_Skyblocker_)
- **H**: Bags Menu `/bags`
- **C**: Equipment Menu `/equipment`
- **B**: Booster Cookie Menu `/boostercookie`
- **U**: Wardrobe Menu `/wardrobe`
- **I**: Storage Menu `/storage`
- **P**: Pets Menu `/pets`
- **Numpad 0**: Warp Menu `/warp`
- **Numpad Period**: Warp to Hub `/hub`

See all default keybinds in the [Default Options][KEYBINDINGS_SOURCE] config
