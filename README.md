# Description

A modpack designed specifically for Hypixel SkyBlock on modern versions.\
Goodbye, 1.8.9, you will be missed...

The **SBModernized** mod-pack will be developed over time to be optimized, pretty, and modifiable. At the moment, SBModernized is just a set of several great mods with preset default configs. However, to get this modpack into a _finished_ state I will be adding custom features to make customization quick and easy, but that's coming in the future.

# How to Use

This modpack is intended to be out-of-box play, but here I'll have helpful tips and potential issues you may run into.

## Requirements

### Minimum

- **OS**: Windows 7+ or Linux/X11
- **Memory**: 6 GB RAM (3 GB Allocated)
- **Storage**: 1 GB available storage

### Recommended

- **OS**: Windows 10+ or Linux/X11
- **Memory**: 12 GB RAM (6144 MB Allocated)

## Setup

1. Like any other Modrinth modpack, simply open this modpack page in the Modrinth App and install your desired version.
2. Before starting the game, open the Settings (_gear icon_), click Java and Memory, and set a custom amount of allocated memory, or use the recommended settings below. Be sure to not set it too high, the very highest you should use is 12 GB.
   - 2560 MB Minimum Allocated
   - **6-8 GB RAM**: 3 GB Allocated
   - **12-16 GB RAM**: 6 GB Allocated
   - **24-32 GB RAM**: 8 GB Allocated
3. Lastly, you can set a custom window size or set fullscreen if desired, then play the game.
4. You can change some settings before starting, but to change certain settings involving UI for mods like BetterF3, Skyblocker, SkyHanni, etc. you must join Hypixel SkyBlock.

Now you should be ready to just play! If you are playing in a resolution other than 1920x1080 you can change the UI as you go, referring to the below tips if needed.

## Resource Packs

It's recommended that you keep all the packs as-is, but here are the purposes of some of the packs.

1. **FurfSky Reborn** is _highly_ recommended for Skyblock and should be at the top. FurfSky is one of the best SkyBlock item resource packs with textures for almost every custom item in SkyBlock.
2. **Cubic** & **Whimscape Leaves** are for more pretty leaves and bushes. These seem to be well optimized but some may need to disable them, or they may not be your cup of tea.
3. **Crops 3D** is for 3D and more pretty crops. May have a minor performance hit, especially on the garden, but appears to be optimized for most systems.
4. **FreshAnimations** is for more lively mob animations. Pretty well optimized and should work fine in most appears, this is purely preference.
5. **Detailed Animations** has beautiful player animations, which also apply to NPCs and some enemies. Not as optimized as other packs, but should run well for most.
6. **No Enchant Glint** is very subjective but I've found it useful as enchant glint can be overwhelming in the Skyblock Ender Chests and Backpacks.
7. **Serified Font** is another preference thing. Has no noticeable performance impact and looks perfect in a majority of UIs, and in some cases simply looks better than Vanilla font.

Try to keep the resource packs in their default order. Cubic Leaves and Whimscape Leaves only work together if Cubic is over Whimscape.

## Visuals

**Resolution**\
Because SBModernized was made for 1920x1080 monitors and optimized for my mid-level PC, other resolutions and PCs may need many changes to the HUD and graphics settings.\
There will be screenshots of different areas of the game with notes on which parts of the HUD are from what mods. For performance, you should be getting 60-80 FPS in the Skyblock Hub while moving around and 80+ FPS means you're likely good for all other areas, so use that area as a good place for testing your graphics especially if you plan to regularly use shaders.

**Shaders**\
They work with a good PC; not high-end level but better than most.\
If the shaders don't run well for you, I recommend primarily playing with them off, then toggling the shaders with K when you want some nicer scenery while Fishing or Foraging.  

**Clouds**\
For optimization, clouds are disabled on all the default shaders and we instead use Better Clouds, which still look good without being taxing on performance.

## User-Interface

**F3 Menu**: Go to `Mods > BetterF3`.

**SkyHanni HUD**: Use key Backslash in-game to modify some of the hud.

**SkyBlocker Widget**: Use command `/widget` to modify SkyBlocker's Tab widgets and some of its hud.

**SkyCubed**: Use command `/skycubed` to access SkyCubed's settings. You can also drag its map and info display (_box with current time_) by opening chat.

## Controls

**Common Keybinds**: Go to `Options > Controls > Key Binds` then use the search bar to find specific binds or browse all.

**SkyBlocker Shortcuts**: Use command `/skyblocker shortcuts` then scroll down to change any keybinds you wish to, including adding or removing any (_note: press 'Esc' after setting any keybind_).
